This package is designed to build monsters and encounters for:
Dungeons and Dragons 5e

The level of each Player Character can be added, the DM can determine
the relative threat level desired and an encounter with appropriately
designed monsters will be generated to meet the specs.

Encounters are based on:
Number and Level of each PC
How many monsters do you want the party to fight
How many TYPES of monster do you want to fight
The expected difficulty of the encounter (easy, medium, hard, deadly, deadly+)


This will then find out the XP budget for the encounter based on input files.
The number of monsters will determing what the XP budgets are for the different difficulties.
The XP range and number of monsters will affect the range of possible Challenge Ratings for those monsters.
Monsters will be "randomly" generated based on thir CR and be given statistics in line with their difficulty.
i.e. Higher challenge monsters will have higher maximum thresholds for stats and have more size options.
