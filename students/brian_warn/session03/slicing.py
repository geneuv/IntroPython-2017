TASKS
Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument,
and return a copy of that sequence:

with the first and last items exchanged.
with every other item removed
with the first and last 4 items removed, and every other item in between
with the elements reversed (just with slicing)
with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order
NOTE: These should work with ANY sequence â€“ but you can use strings to test,
if you like.
